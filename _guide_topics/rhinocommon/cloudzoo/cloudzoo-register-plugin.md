In Cloud Zoo, an _issuer_ represents a vendor of products with license keys. If you want your plugin to use Cloud Zoo, you must register to be an issuer by emailing [aj@mcneel.com](mailto:aj@mcneel.com). You will be provided with an issuer id and a secret that will uniquely identify you as a product vendor and will allow you to implement the required HTTPS callbacks.
