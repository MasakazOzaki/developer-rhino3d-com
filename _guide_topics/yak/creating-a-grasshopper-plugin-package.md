<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Note:</strong> Yak is cross-platform. The examples below are for Windows.
For Mac, replace the path to the Yak CLI tool with
<code>/Applications/Rhinoceros.app/Contents/Resources/bin/yak</code>.
</div>

First, let's assume you have a folder on your computer which contains all the
files that you would like to distribute in your package. Something like this...

```commandline
C:\Users\Bozo\dist
â”œâ”€â”€ Marmoset.gha
â”œâ”€â”€ Marmoset.dll
â””â”€â”€ misc\
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ LICENSE.txt
```

We're going to use the Yak CLI tool to create the package, so open up a Command
Prompt and navigate to the directory above.

```commandline
> cd C:\Users\Bozo\dist
```

Now, we need a `manifest.yml` file! You can easily create your own by studying
the [Manifest Reference Guide](../the-package-manifest). Alternatively, you can use the `spec`
command to generate a skeleton file. We'll do the latter here.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino 6\System\Yak.exe" spec

Inspecting content: Plankton.gha

name: marmoset
version: 1.0.0
authors:
- <author>
description: <description>
url: <url>
secret:
  id: c9beedb9-07ec-4974-a0a2-44670ddb17e4


Saved to C:\Users\Bozo\dist\manifest.yml
```

The `spec` command takes a look at the current directory and, if present, will
glean useful information from the `.gha` assembly and use it generate a
`manifest.yml` with name, version, authors, etc. pre-populated. If you haven't
added this information, then placeholders will be used.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Note:</strong> You might notice your plug-in's GUID lurking in the
<code>secret/id</code> key. More information on how this is used can be found in
the <a href="../package-restore-in-grasshopper">"Package Restore in Grasshopper"
</a> guide.
</div>

Open the manifest file with your [favourite editor](http://atom.io) and fill in
the gaps.

Afterwards, you should have something that looks a little like this...

```yaml

name: marmoset
version: 1.0.0
authors:
- Will Pearson
description: >
  This plug-in does something. I'm not really sure exactly what it's supposed to
  do, but it does it better than any other plug-in.
url: example.com
secret:
  id: c9beedb9-07ec-4974-a0a2-44670ddb17e4
```

Now that we have a manifest file, we can build the package!

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino 6\System\Yak.exe" build

Building package from contents of C:\Users\Bozo\dist

â””â”€â”€ misc\README.md
```

Congratulations! ðŸ™Œ You've just created a Yak package for your Grasshopper
plug-in.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a package, why not
[push it to the Yak server](../pushing-a-package-to-the-server) to make it
available to everyone else!
